Bitcoin Private
=============

Intro
-----
Bitcoin Private uses the same privacy technology as ZClassic (zk-snarks). This means payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient and other transactional metadata remain unidentifiable.
Open Source

Bitcoin Private's entire codebase is publicly available for viewing and verification by anyone. It will always remain open source and be maintained by an ever growing community.
Decentralized

Just like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private supports peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public ledger.

Fast

Unlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private supports a slightly increased block size while being more anonymous and secure than any existing Bitcoin-based currency without sacrificing transaction speeds.
Community Driven

In the nature of transparency and open source, Bitcoin Private is developed by team members all over the world. Each member fills roles and contributes based on his or her skill sets.
A Fair Start

There was no premine, and there is no founder's reward. Bitcoin Private has been released in a fair manner to all. Coins were distributed on a 1:1 basis to BTC and ZCL holders.


Setup
